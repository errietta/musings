What is a feminist?
Someone who fights
for the right of wives,
sisters, daughters.
As long as they appear feminine to you.
As long as you're sure they're cis.
As long as they're able bodied, and pretty, and thin.

If that's the feminism you want,
I'll burn it to the ground.
Either include every woman out there,
or you might as well include none.

Was she a woman when she was thin,
and had long hair?
If she had a buzzcut and gained weight
and if you couldn't easily tell her sex,
is she still a woman to you then?

Does she need to strip in front of you?
If those are your standards, then 
who is the pervert?
