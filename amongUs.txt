There is one impostor among us.
And it is me.
I lied to get where I am
Again and again and again and again.

On the temple of success
I've sacrificed each and every friendship.
I'm a snake, I live as I do.
My morals are none,
What matters is money.

The self-hate I feel,
Needless to say,
How one so small
Could so far stray?

It ends tonight,
Because I admit it;
I'm the impostor,
And I don't mind.

Because when I get there,
I always prove I deserve it.
The reason I lie, 
Is you expect me
To meet requirements more than expected
From a cishet white guy.
Well then I'll lie.
So long as the job gets done,
Then you won't mind.
