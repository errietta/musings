First there was David, eaten by greed.
Then dear Theresa, limping and weak.
Then there was Boris, resigned in shame.
Liz Truss could barely spell her own name.

Now there is Rishi,
more of the same.
Lining his cabinet with fascists,
he gets his 15 minutes of fame.

Keeping us distracted,
banning protesting,
thinks you're too stupid,
the plebs he's detesting.

When we freeze this winter
you'll be glad to know
that people far richer
than you keep their place.
