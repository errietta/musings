If I want a dick
if I want a beard
If she has them both
then why do you care?

I'll never be beautiful
and I'll be offensive
your sensitive taste in men
means nothing to me.

Was born as your daughter
Live more like a monster
the lines between what's
proper or not have long since been blurred.

I'm a fat fuck
And I'm fucking depressed
I'm autistic and
dark thoughts fuck up my head.

You want a girl who wants it all
career, husband and children.
Living in a suburban paradise
yet with easy access to the city.

I've picked the parts of life I want
the parts I will reject,
The social norms left far away
for feeling me with dread.

I'd rather be a dude with tits,
or be a bearded lady,
than to fit in with your expectations
of an era long past its prime.

I look wrong and 
I look weird and
I act like I don't fit and-
This is me now. 

Your approval was something I'd seek
and now it's all just wasted.
I'm a cryptic, silly mess.
Fuck off if you don't like it.
