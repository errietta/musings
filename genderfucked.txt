I've been a woman.
I've been a man.
I've been a gender bending nightmare.
I've traced through lines of binary code
And traced the skin of nonbinary people.
I'm genderfucked.
I'm the quantum supercomputer AI
in a world of Intels and AMDs.
The hacker sitting at the Starbucks
Could never crack my code.
