Live to work,
Give up the last 
Piece of yourself for the company.
Long hours under fluorescent light,
Losing more and more of what's left
Of yourself, of joy, of hope.
In this you take pride
Gloating about your own oppression.
The enemy inside
More of a threat than the one
At the top of the food chain.
Billionaire fuck boys can do what they want
As long as you're morally better
Than the guy sitting in the same room,
In the same chair,
But in the office across the road.
And I'm a hypocrite
Because I'm one and the same.
